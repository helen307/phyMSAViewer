## Introduction

**phyMSAViewer** is a helpful tool that enables users to have a general overview on multiple selected sequences. It also provides multiple sequence alignment on the side and enables users to zoom on a particular range of the multiple sequence alignment to have a better view of the amino acids. Function **uniprotToPhy** enables users to view the phylogenetic tree with the multiple sequence alignment by entering Uniprot IDs. Function **seqToPhy** enables users to view the phylogenetic tree with the multiple sequence alignment by providing a fasta file containg the selected sequences. The shiny implementation of *phyMSAViewer* is available as [runPhyMSAViewer](https://helen307.shinyapps.io/phymsaviewerapp/) (still under construction, will be available for the final submission). For more information, see details below. This document gives a tour of phyMSAViewer functionalities. It was written in Rmarkdown, using the [knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr) package for production.

See `help(package=phyMSAViewer)` for further details and references provided by `citation("phyMSAViewer")`. To download **phyMSAViewer**, use the following commands: 
```{r setup}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("helen307/phyMSAViewer", build_vignettes=TRUE)
library(phyMSAViewer)
```

To list all functions available in the package:
```{r}
lsf.str("package:phyMSAViewer")

## MSA algorithm

Normally building a phylogenetic tree starts from providing with a sequence fasta file. In this package, we allow users to start by typing in the Uniprot IDs. Then we download the sequence data from Swiss-Prot. The reason why we chose to perform MSA (multiple sequence alignment) using the algorithm `MUSCLE` is because ClusterW implements an interative method. Therefore, the calculation errors will be accumulated. `MUSCLE` has a progressive algorithm that optimizes at each step. Here is an image that explains the alogrithm of MUSCLE in detail:

## Creation of phylogenetic trees
We used the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm to create our phylogenetic tree after we obtain the pairwise distances from the sequences. This algorithm joins the two closest sub-trees that are not already joined. A "neighbor" is defined as two texa that are connected by a single node in an unrooted tree. Here is an image showing how the NJ algorithm perform its greedy actions:

## Example
We will expect the users to enter a list of Uniprot IDs separated by "OR"s.
```{r example}
library(phyMSAViewer)
uniprotToPhy <- function(ID="AC=P19838 OR AC=Q00653 OR AC=Q01201")
# Access the phylogenetic tree with MSA plot directly from the object.
uniprotToPhy
```
